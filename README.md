### Setting up Environment

Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a python 3.7 environment.

### Running Code

A utility file `run.py` has been provided. This will run all experiments and generate all visualizations used in the report. All output, including saved results and exported plots, will be stored in the `output` folder. This will take several hours to complete unless you happen to have a freakin supercomputer. To use the script, simply run:
`python run.py` and grab a snack.
